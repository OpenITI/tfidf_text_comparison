# TFIDF Analysis

The script is designed to identify similar texts among RAW data scraped from various websites. The script compares texts from OpenITI RELEASE with files form any other specified folder and generates TSV data with results: 

- known text (URI/filename)
- unknown text (filename)
- distance (TFIDF-based)

The script requires:

- the OpenITI RELEASE data (path to folder)
- the OpenITI RELEASE metadata file (path to file)
- data to analyze (path to folder; assumed that there are only text files; the format of those files doues not matter)


Script report example:
